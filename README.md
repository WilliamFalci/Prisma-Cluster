## Disclaimer

Prisma Cluster is not officially Releated to Prisma.io , I named this project "Prisma Cluster" because it use the powerfull of Prisma's introspection and interfacing .

This project have the goal to make more "simple" make an Microservice infrastructure and use it with an RPC server to provide data. The same project is already pre-configured to be scalable in a Replication structure where this project has a slave DB from an exnternal Master.

The Repository will be updated everytime it's needed, the same project is released with Open Source License, The usage and configuration is your business.

----------------------

<a name="what_is"></a>

## What is Prisma Cluster?

Prisma Cluster is an **Full Stack Service Manager**, using the Next-Generation ORM [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) and the Powerfull of [Jayson RPC](https://github.com/tedeh/jayson) + Dockerized Postgres, Prisma Cluster allow you to create an cluster of Databases with: 

- (Optional Slave DB connected with external Parent DB)
- Unique Database per service with specify user / credentials
- Automatic link to Service DB with Service Controller and RPC server
- Automatic Storage creation for the service and auto-link with the service's controllers
- Full Backup creation
- Full Rollback to an specific Backup
- Service deletion tracker
- Import Tables / Data from existing projects
- Generate Model and Interface using Database Introspection

All that just using the CLI, allowing you to focus on logical service architecture without lose time on configurations and links.

**Prisma** is the **ORM**, generate the models and client interface (for client interface I mean the client library to retrieve database objects)

**Jayson** is the **RPC Compilant**, will be in listening on TCP Port (default: 3000) and will determinate the service's router, method and controler to invoke

**Node-Filestorage** is the **Storage Engine**, will handle the storage, please read the documentation here: [petersirka/node-filestorage](https://github.com/petersirka/node-filestorage)

**Cron** is the **Cron Job Tool**, will handle the cron jobs, please read the documentation here: [kelektiv/node-cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron#readme)

<p align="center">Look at <a href="#locigal_architecture">Logical Architecture</a> to understand the pipeline</p>


- **Why Prisma Cluster is in listening on TCP and not on HTTP/s?**

Simple, many devs / sites / platforms are already stuctured with API, plus for security reasons many don't want expose directly the Database server, so... to make comfortable with the major realities outside here the most simple solution is to make the RPC call from your API server, in this way the API server will delivery directly the result of the RPC call without expose the database server

- - **Import**: ```yarn rpc db import [service-name] [file-to-import.sql]```
- **MASTER INTERFACE**
- - **Generate**: ```yarn rpc master_interface generate```
- - **Update**: ```yarn rpc master_interface update```

#### SERVICE > CONNECT:
- Will connect the master interface to the method
- - This command must be runned ONLY if you use the db: Master - which contain data external of the service
- - Before run this command you need generate the master_interface using the command: ```yarn rpc master_interface update```

#### SERVICE > CREATE:
- In case of only master interface you have to run: ```yarn rpc service create [service-name] false true```
- Will create the service running automatically this actions:
- - Service Folder Structure under ```./services/[service-name]```
- - RPC Router injection in ```[root]/router.js```
- - Creation of [service-name] db into Postgress (skipped whith create_credentials setted to false) 
- - Creation of user's db (ower of [service-name] db) (skipped whith create_credentials setted to false) 
- - Saving of enviroment variables to link prisma to db created (skipped whith create_credentials setted to false) 
- - Creation of the specific Storage Bucket

#### SERVICE > DELETE:
- Will delete the service running automatically this actions:
- - Deletion of ```./services/[service-name]```
- - Deletion of [service-name] DB
- - Deletion of [service-name] DB's user
- - Deletion of enviroment variables related to [service-name] DB's user
- - Deletion of [service-name] router injection into RPC router ```[root]/router.js```
- - Create a deletion file under ```./services-deleted/``` named with [service-name] and containing Operator's Name and Reason of deletion
- - Deletion of Storage logical link
- - Physically deletion of Service's stored files (optional)

#### SERVICE > METHOD:
- The usage of "master_only" option will work only if you already generated the master_interface, the CLI will generate the Service's Method and Controller without create an specific Database, Credentials and DB Interface, this kind of service must be used if you need create a Service using only the data of Master DB (so you are running this project in replication mode), anyway will be created always and specific Service's Storage.
- ADD:
- - Whitout "master_only" option will create the method of the service running automatically this actions:
- - - Creation of [method-name] controller under ```./services/[service-name]/controllers/[method-name]_controller.js```
- - - Creation of [method-name] method under ```./services/[service-name]/methods/[method-name]_method.js```
- - - Injection of [method-name] into [service-name]'s router
- - - Auto configuration of [method-name] controller with [service-name]'s model interface into ```[method-name]_controller.js```
- DELETE:
- - Will delete the method of the service running automatically this actions:
- - - Deletion of [method-name] controller under ```./services/[service-name]/controllers/[method-name]_controller.js```
- - - Deletion of [method-name] method under ```./services/[service-name]/methods/[method-name]_method.js```
- - - Deletion of injection into [service-name]'s router
- - - Auto configuration of [method-name] controller with [service-name]'s model interface into ```[method-name]_controller.js```
#### SERVICE > MIGRATE:
- Apply schema changes to DB
- Make migration file

#### SERVICE > DEPLOY (MUST BE RUNNED ONLY ON DEV / PRODUCTION)
- Apply migrations to DB
- Loop the ```./services-deleted``` to check if some services must be deleted

#### SERVICE > JOBS
- Will generate an service's cron jobs handler under: ```./RPC/Jobs/services/[service-name].js``` the execution will be handled by ```./RPC/Jobs/index.js``` automatically
- - Use ```include_master``` only if you need connect the Job with the DB Master's Data
- - The Job will be automatically connected with: Service's Interface, Service's Storage
- THe logic part of cron job will be under his own key in ```./RPC/Jobs/services/[service-name].js```

#### SERVICE > STUDIO
- Will serve Prisma Studio for the target service on http://localhost:5555

#### BACKUP > CREATE:
- Will create a full dump of all DBs (Schema and Data
- Will create a Bk of current enviroment variables
- Will create a Bk of all current services controllers and routes
- Will zip the all previous points

#### BACKUP > ROLLBACK (ATTENTION ON USE IT):
- Will apply the backup you specifiend deleting all services and databases to re-apply them from the backup

#### DB > IMPORT:
- Will run the sql file to the service's db, the file must be located under `./DB/import`

#### DB > FETCH (ATTENTION ON USE IT):
- This command will fetch the entire database generating Prisma model, the usage scenario is when you need import structure from an already exist DB (so previously you used DB > Import) and then you need generate the model's interface, if you use it outside this scenario be carefull on generate conflicts with migrations
- Please read  <a href="#how-init-service-from-existing-schema">How init service from existing schema</a> to avoid conflicts on migration process

#### MASTER INTERFACE > GENERATE:
- Will generate the interface of Master DB

#### MASTER INTERFACE > UPDATE:
- Will update the interface of Master DB

## POSTGRES REPLICATION SLAVE MODE

### Quick Start

- From ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/env``` make ```.env.replication``` from ```.blank.env.replication``` replacing the values
- Locate ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/scripts``` and run ```MAKE_REPL_USER_SQL.sh``` this will generate ```00-Create_repl_user.sql``` under ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/init```
- Locate ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/config``` make ```pg_hba.conf``` and ```postgresql.conf``` from ```blank.pg_hba.conf``` and ```blank.postgresql.conf```
- Locate ```prisma-cluster/DB``` make ```docker-compose.replication.yml``` from ```blank.docker-compose.replication.yml``` and replace value
- Using ```prisma-cluster/DB/server.sh replication up --build -d``` (for the building and up) or ```./database/server.sh replication up -d``` (for the up) Docker will run Postgres with Replication's Configuration, fetched from ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/config```.

#### If Docker return permission denied on conf files please be sure to fix the permission, example:
![image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36926081/158415349-13ad3194-49fd-45d0-ab66-187a8e820e76.jpg)

#### Concept
Considering the scenario of 2 Postgres Servers:

- First Server: MAIN data center (where you stored all your data like, users, orders, invoices or other kind of data)
- Second Server: Prisma Cluster Postgres Server (so this project)

In a scenario like that you need "move" the data from First Server to the Second, the Replication Mode allow you to run the Second Server in "Slave" mode ready to receive Publications from the First Server, you have just to configure some lines :P\

#### Configuration on First Server:

- Create the user will run the publications: ```sql CREATE ROLE [first-server-replication-user] REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD '[first-server-replication-user-password]';```
- Edit the ```pg_hba.conf``` (usually located in ```/var/lib/postgresql/data/```) adding: ```host    all             [POSTGRES_REPLICATION_USER from ./database/.env.replication]       slave_node              md5``` under IPv4 connections
- Edit the ```postgresql.conf``` enable ```wal_level``` and set it to ```logical```
- Make a host rule for ```slave_node``` and point it to this project host

#### Configuration Second Server (this project):
In ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/env/env.replication``` apply:

- master_node: your First Server IP
- PARENT_REPLICATION_DB: the db's name contain the data into First Server
- PARENT_REPLICATION_USER: user will rul the publications on First Server
- PARENT_REPLICATION_PASSWORD: user's password will run the publication on First Server
- Under ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/scripts``` run ```MAKE_REPL_USER_SQL.sh``` - This script will generate automatically the SQL to create replication user of this project

#### Creation of a publication (to run on First Server):

- Run ```psql CREATE PUBLICATION [table-name]_pub FOR TABLE [table-name];``` - This will create the publication
- Run ```psql GRANT ALL ON [table-name] TO [first-server-replication-user];``` - This will grant the access
- Run ```psql pg_dump -U [first-server-root] -d [first-server-db] -t [table-name] -s | psql -U [POSTGRES_SLAVE_USER from ./database/.env.replication] -d master -h slave_node``` this will apply the schema on slave server (this poject server)
- Now you can subscribe from the slave server 

#### Subscription (to run from Second Server)

- From ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/scripts``` run ```single-subscription.sh [table-name]```


If you did everything right then will work XD



What do this script? The script will add the table to ```tables``` to keep track of tables subscribed, then generate the SQL of subscription under ```prisma-cluster/DB/replication/init``` in this way everytime the docker will be mounted will import the subscriptions if they not exist already, then if the docker container is running will directly invoke psql to generate the subscription

----------------------

<a name="howtoclone"></a>
## Use this project in real case of development/production

- Create your own empty private repository
- Clone the project ```https://github.com/WilliamFalci/Prisma-Cluster.git```
- Run ```cd Prisma-Cluster```
- Run ```git remote rename origin public```
- Run ```git remote set-url --push public DISABLE```
- Run ```git remote add own [uri-of-your-private-repository]```

In this way:

- You will be able to fetch/pull from this public repository
- You will be able to fetch/pull/push from your own private repository
- You will be able to modify the gitignore based on your necessity

----------------------

<a name="how-init-service-from-0"></a>

- Before everything we must create the service running ```yarn rpc service create [service-name]```
- At this point the CLI created the service folder's structure + the blank DB on postgres + the DB's credentials on enviroment, but not the interface, why? Because the DB is empty
- We must "init" our DB with at least 1 table to generate the interface, running ```yarn rpc service schema [service-name]``` the service's schema will be opened
- Referer to [Prisma Schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema) to create your tables
- After this we have to generate our first migration running the command ```yarn rpc service migrate [service-name]```, this command will go to apply the changes of schema to DB, will generate the migration file and will create/update the interface
- Now we can create our service's methods, running ```yarn rpc service method [service-name] add [method-name], this command will geneterate the method and relative controller already linked with the interface ect.

## How init service from existing schema

To understand this workflow we have to consider a scenario where you need make a service importing the relative tables from another DB. To help to understand I prepared an example.

In this example I need make an service named: emailer
- I will run: ```yarn rpc service create emailer```
- After that I need import 7 tables from my old DB named "production" so I will generated 2 dumps, the first one just with tables structure, the second dump will contain just the data.
- At this point I will place the first one (schema only) named ```01-Emailer.sql``` ```into /prisma-cluster/DB/import``` then I will run ```yarn rpc db import emailer 01-Emailer.sql```
- This will go to generate the 7 tables into Emailer's service database, at this point I need generate the model's interface and sync prisma to the current status, to do that I will run ```yarn rpc db fetch emailer```, the CLI will alert you about ```Drift detected``` asking you to confirm the sync (this will normally delete all your data, but in our workflow we haven't data so is ok, confirm)
- After the confirm the Service's Model, Schema and Migration are perfectly in sync, so now you can import your data, copy the second dump (data only) named ```02-Emailer_data.sql``` into ```/prisma-cluster/DB/import``` then run ```yarn rpc db import 02-Emailer_data.sql```

Damn! I wrong something and I need re-init the service excluding it from "services-deleted" how I cand do it?

So.. if you haven't already runned the command ```yarn rpc service delete [service-name]``` do it, this command will delete all the relative enviroments variables of the service, will delete the relative DB, data, and storage, then will generate an file named with the service's name under the folder ```services-deleted``` if you want exclude this deletion from the deletion's tracking, you have just to delete the file.

Then you will be free to re-create the service

## What about if in replication mode the Parent DB change some columns?

Imagine you have the table users in both servers Parent Server and Slave Server, the slave is obviously the DB of this project, and you are running it in replication mode.

You already made the publication on Parent Server and the subscription on the Slave, so you have already received the data, but... for some reason you need change the data type of an Column on the Parent DB, plus you add another column and drop another one, always on the Parent Server.

What will happen?

The Slave DB will not be more able to apply the data for those columns, why? The logical replication is just a data replication, not structural this mean you have to handle those changes.

How handle those changes?

So... if you want do it manually you can do it, else... I made this little tool in node: [node-pg-compare](https://github.com/WilliamFalci/node-pg-compare)

Following the "How to use" of Node-Pg-Compare you will get the SQL File to apply ont Prisma-Cluster, to apply it follow those steps:

- Copy the SQL File generated with node-pg-compare to ```./DB/import/```
- Run the following command ```yarn rpc db import master [sql-filename].sql```
