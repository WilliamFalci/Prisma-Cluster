THIS FOLDER IS AN EXAMPLE OF SCRIPTS AND CONFIGURATION FOR YOUR PARENT DATABASE IN REPLICATION MODE!

The content of this folder must be edited under your own skills and project structure.


The logic is:

SCRIPTS:
./scripts/MAKE_REPL_USER.sh -> Generate the sql file containing the query for generate the repl_user
./scripts/single-publication.sh -> Generate the Publication on Parent DB for the specified table and store the table's name into ./table file
./scripts/publication.sh -> Generate the Publications for all the tables stored into ./table file (ideally to run on restoring db or transfer)

CONFIGS:
./postgresql.conf and ./pg_hba.conf are mandatory to set Postgres in Logical Replication (you can just copy and paste those files, just remove the dot before the name)

ENVIROMENT:
./.replication.env must contain both connection details (parent and slave) + the docker container name of Parent if is running under docker


DOCKER:
If your Parent DB is running under docker you need edit your .yml

Under the potsgres container you need:
  volumes:
    - dev_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    - dev_postgres_data_backups:/backups
    - dev_postgres_config:/cluster_config
  extra_hosts:
    - slave_node:${POSTGRES_SLAVE_HOST}
  command: postgres -c config_file=/cluster_config/postgresql.conf -c hba_file=/cluster_config/pg_hba.conf
  configs:
      - source: pg_hba
        target: /cluster_config/pg_hba.conf
      - source: postgresql
        target: /cluster_config/postgresql.conf

Under root of the file:
  configs:
    pg_hba:
      file: ./compose/dev/postgres/replication/pg_hba.conf
    postgresql:
      file: ./compose/dev/postgres/replication/postgresql.conf


Logical explanation:

[Root Configs] declare the configurations files must be copied into Posgress Container inside [cluster_config] volume, the command go to set those files like configuration files for postgres

Then probably you will need an script to parse properly the enviroments variable, look the server.sh example in this directory to understand
